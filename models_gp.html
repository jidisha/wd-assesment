		<h1> Report </h1>
		<h2>Introduction</h2><br>
		<p>
			This aim of this project was to create multiple web pages for a personal CV site. Six web pages  index.html, about.html, cv.html, social.html, contact.html and models_gp, were created for this CV site. All of these pages were created using HTML and the design was done using CSS. The designs were inspired from the user interface design trends. Wireframes were also made for the project on the basis of current degsine trends. Experience on learning web develpment was also mentioned. All the codes were tested using validators. 
		</p>

		<h2>User Interface Design</h2>
		 <a href=”https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-35-best-personal-websites-weve-ever-seen> The muse</a> is one of the sites that I came across the CV photograph of Krista Gray.<br><br><img src="pics/krista.png" width="500"> <br><br> Her websites front page inspired me for mine. I wanted a header with my name on and the my photo with rounded edges from this. <a href=https://jasminestar.com/>  Jasmine Star’s</a> website inspired me to add a navigation bar on the side.<br><br><img src="pics/jasmin.png" width= "500"><br>

				<h1>Experience</h1>

				<p class="normal">This term taught me how HTML and CSS play an important part in making a web page come to life.
		 At first we learned how to use html tags and create a basic web page. Then we learnt different CSS properties which added the design components in the web page and also that linking one css page to multiple html pages is what makes creating web pages easier. 
		Creating web pages for my professional cv was the goal of this assignment. At first I looked at existing CV sites for inspiration.
			<p>As a whole I learnt how to use HTML and CSS to create this website. Doing so helped me understand designing a lot better and I believe this will help me to improve my designing skill for future. The website I have created is not the best but it is my first step to making better websites. This assignment has help me to master the basics of creating a website.

			<h1>Wireframes</h1>
			<p> And I decided to add a box with my name on the middle. The wireframe I came up after this was......<br><br><img src="pics/frame1.jpg" width='500' height="500"><br><br> for my about page I decide that I would keep the same design as my index page but remove my picture. For my CV page I used flex colums and wrote my qualification keeping the navigation, header and footer the same. I decide that replacing my name with CV made the page look true to its content. in the social links page I just added all my social links and you can access the links through the icons of the desired media. in the contact page you can see my location on Google maps and there is also a form in which stores the information provide by people who want me to contact them. I changed up the designs a bit to make add my personal touch. I decided to add a navigation bar that look as though it was floating.<br><br>

			<h1>Code validation</h1>
			<p > I used W3C validator to validate my html codes.I corrected the codes after the validation was done. I validated all my pages<br><br> <img src="pics/val1.png" width="500"><br><br>
				index.html<br><br><img src="pics/val2.png" width="500"><br><br>about.html<br><br><img src="pics/val3.png" width="500"><br><br>cv.html<br> <img src="pics/val4.png" width="500"><br><br>model_gp.html<br><br><img src="pics/val5.png" width="500"><br><br>social.html<br><br> <img src="pics/val6.png" width="500"><br><br>contact.html<br>
			</p>
			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>
